  <h1> Description of the Algorithms </h1>
  The function takes in your parameters as you rank them as well as 
        any limiting parameters such as date, name, etc. The function runs a SQL
        query for each stat you input (limited by the params) and then returns a
        list of 90 players (to avoid regression as much as possible without 
        pulling too mamy people if the search parameters are lax). These 90
        players are then assigned a ranking based on their position in the top 90
        list for a given stat. After all ranks have been created, the algorithm loops
        through the players and assigns them a power index based on their position in 
        each statistic and the number of statistics for which they appeared in the top
        90. Then, the algorithm runs through the players and places the ones with the
        highest power indices into the team. If the team cannot be completed, the 
        algorithm will recurse with looser parameters and try again. If, after the name
        parameter (if it exists) has been completely removed, the algorithm still cannot
        create a full team, it simply returns the partial team. Our rationale for using
        looser parameters to try to complete the team is that it's better for the
        purposes of team stats and win total calculations to use a team with 
        inexactly generated parameters than to have an incomplete team, as this
        would render most stats meaningless.

  <h1> Player Stats </h1>
  <strong>Wins above replacement by a position player (WARs_nonpitcher): </strong> take offensive, baserunning, and fielding runs created by a pitcher and converts them into total runs created above a replacement player. Converts this into a win total
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>On Base Percentage (OBPs):</strong> total times reaching base divided by
            total plate appearances
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Batting average (AVGs):</strong> calculated by taking total number of 
            hits divided by total number of plate appearances
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Slugging Percentage (SLGs):</strong> derived by dividing the total number
            of bases gained (e.g. a double is 2 bases) by the total number of PAs;
            a decent proxy for power hitting ability
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Base running ability (UBRs):</strong> Measures baserunning ability. An average baserunner has an UBR of zero
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Weighted Runs Created (WRCs):</strong> Attempts to quantify runs created, except that this stat normalizes the league average to 100
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Win Probability Added (WPAs):</strong> basically like WRC but weighted for the importance of each at bat in terms of how it changed its team's win probability
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Clutch hitting ability (clutchs):</strong> Measures how much better or worse a player's performance in high stress environments is than his overall performance
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h1> Pitcher Stats </h1>
  <strong>Wins above replacement by a pitcher (WARs_pitcher):</strong> derived using FIP adjusted for park and innings pitched to create an estimate of how many runs better the pitcher has been than a replacement level minor leaguer
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Earned runs allowed per 9 innings (ERAs):</strong> derived by taking
            the number of earned runs allowed, normalizing to per game by multiplying
            by 9, and then dividing by number of innings pitched
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Innings Pitched (IPs):</strong> the number of innings a pitcher has thrown in his career
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Games Started (GSs):</strong> the number of games a pitcher has started in his career
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Fielding Independent Pitching (FIPs):</strong> estimates a pitcher's
            abilities normalized for the defense playing behind him
            Takes into account home runs, walks, strikeouts, and hit by pitch
            Formula: ((13*HR)+(3*(BB+HBP))-(2*K))/IP + constant
            The constant normalizes FIP to ERA so the two can be compared
            and is usually around 3.10
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>ERA to FIP spread (E_Fs):</strong> a way to measure how good or bad the team behind a pitcher
            was at fielding
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Strikeouts per 9 innings percentage (KK_Pers):</strong> a way to measure team-independent pitching ability
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Walks per 9 innings rate (BB_Pers):</strong> a way to measure control and overall pitching ability
